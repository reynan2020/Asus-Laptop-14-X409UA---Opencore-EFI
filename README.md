# Asus-Laptop-14-X409UA Opencore-EFI

**DISCONTINUED - This repo is not updated anymore.**

This EFI doesn't currently support macOS Monterey due to some issues. I do not recommend installing macOS Monterey at this time. Updates will be uploaded soon.

**Note:** I don't guarantee that this EFI will work with similar configurations.

**BOOTLOADER: OPENCORE**
