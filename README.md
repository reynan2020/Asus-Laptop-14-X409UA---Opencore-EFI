# Asus-Laptop-14-X409UA Opencore-EFI

This (my) EFI file may not work on laptops other than the laptop model specified.
-DSDT-patched.aml is disabled by default in config.plist. (Don't try to load it because it may cause issues)
-Do some edits / make changes to the config.plist (SMBIOS, Patches, etc.)

Thanks to Acidanthera for Opencore bootloader, Rehabman for patches, and many others.

Current Opencore Version: 0.6.1
